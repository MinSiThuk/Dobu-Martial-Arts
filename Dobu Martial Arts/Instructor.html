    <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">Mauricio Gomez (gym 
        owner/head martial arts 
        coach)</h1>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">Mauricio began training in Jiu-Jitsu at just four years of age. His father, who was a brown belt, started his journey and took him to classes at João Alberto Barreto’s academy.

        As a teenager, Mauricio began training with the legendary Rolls Gracie. Under Rolls' guidance, he became a highly successful competitor and won the absolute division of the Rio de Janeiro State Championships in 1981. Shortly after this victory Rolls would award Mauricio his black belt. Mauricio continued training with Rolls until his tragic death in 1982.
        
        Through his close ties with the Gracie family, Mauricio met Reila Gracie, the daughter of Carlos Gracie Sr. The two married and, although their relationship didn't last, they had a son, Roger Gracie. Roger would go on to become a ten-time World Champion and is widely recognised as being the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time.
        
        In the late 1990s, Mauricio came to the UK and established the very first Gracie Barra gym there. Through his teaching, many new gyms would open and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is now the fastest growing martial art in the UK.</p>

            </h1>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">A student of boxing since he was a child, Bert Harbour enjoys defending himself and learning the “sweet science” of boxing.

            The boxing coach with a shaved head, smaller stature and little body fat loves his work with his Airdrie Boxing Club inside the Airdrie Martial Arts Centre.
            
            “I was basically told by my dad, ‘You have to defend yourself and take care of yourself or you’re going to be backing down to everybody because you’re a smaller guy,’” recalls Harbour.
            
            Despite being athletic his entire life, Harbour never stepped into the ring until four years ago at the age of 41. He played many other sports growing up, and coached his two sons in a variety of athletics, too.
            
            He’s a huge boxing advocate, and when the opportunity presented itself, he opened up the club in January 2017.</p>
